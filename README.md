# Challenge-Wk2

## Portfolio

### Description
Having a portfolio deployed with active web applications is a good practice for every web developer. My tasks at the end of week two is to set up my very own portfolio, with an attractive layout and array of apps. I am expected to apply the core skills acquired over the period such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Once again ‘HTML Semantic Elements’ and Agile Project Management’ are key principles that must be factored into this project. Once again anther daunting task, matched with an equal resolve to do justice to it.

### Usage
This repo is made up of the core files and folders related to the task. It contains a folder with an animated image of the mock-up I am expecting to produce with a few creative additions. I have added comments to all the relevant sections of the code to highlight key areas and further explain the design.  The content comprise only that related to the challenge; all other materials are removed for obvious reasons. 

### Feedback
Please feel free to reach out or drop a comment here if you have any questions, queries or suggestions. Otherwise, you can find me on the Slack platform Pod 5, just search for Rod.
